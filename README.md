# Spotify game

I chose the Spotify API, to run this app you'll need Spotify OAuth token. To get it go to [Spotify API console](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=Dasher&type=artist&market=&limit=&offset=&include_external=) and down click on "Get token". Then copy it to the .env file as "NUXT_ENV_API_KEY=".

Find your favourite bands/albums and guess which of the two offered songs are more popular.

## Instructions

### What we want you to build?

You can build anything you want. It's up to your imagination :)

There are just a few things, that this app should include:

- Use some API (anything you want) - for data fetching and manipulating
  - or you can build your own api within the nuxt app
- Show data to users
- Let users manipulate with data or let them create their own data
- For styles use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- 

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
